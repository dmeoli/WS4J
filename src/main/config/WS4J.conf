# This is a master list of comments as used in the example configuration
# files found in this directory. This is not intended to be used as a
# configuration file but rather as a plain text summary of possible options
# and their values. In fact, the measures will not accept this as a
# configuration file.
# 
# All of these options have default values that are described below. The 
# only exception to this is vectordb, which has no default. If an option is 
# listed without a value (as in trace:: or cache:: ), then the default value
# is used. 
# 
# Note that in the configuration files anything following a # is treated as
# a comment, so the following text can be used directly in a configuration
# file. You will want to make sure to change the value of an option as fits 
# your needs however!

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported for all measures

trace = 0         # Turns off (0) tracing. Turn on tracing by setting
                  # to 1 or 2. The effect of these different levels will
                  # depend on the measure being used. The default value 
                  # is off (0). If the value is omitted, then the default 
                  # is used. 0, 1, and 2 are the only valid settings.

cache = 1         # Turns on (1) caching. Turn off caching by setting 
                  # to 0. The default is on (1). If the value is omitted,
                  # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
                  # settings.

memoryDB = 0      # WordNet DB is loaded on memory when memoryDB (1).
                  # WordNet DB stays on disk when memoryDB (0).

MFS = 1           # Use Most Frequent Sense when (1).
                  # Use all sense combinations when (0). 
                  # MFS increases calculation speed up.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option will be supported by path, lch, 
# wup, res, lin and jcn measure

# rootNode = 1    # Turns on (1) a (hypothetical) top-level root node for
                  # the nouns, and another for the verbs. Turn off the 
                  # root nodes by setting to 0. The default is to use (1) 
                  # a unique top-level root node. If the value is omitted,
                  # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
                  # settings. 
                  # THIS VALUE IS ALWAYS 1 IN CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by res, lin and jcn measure

infoContent = ic-semcor.dat

                  # Specifies the name of an information content file under 
                  # data/. The value of this option must be the name of a
                  # file, or a relative or absolute path name. The default
                  # value of this option ic-semcor.dat.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by vector and lesk measure

stem = 0          # Turns on (1) stemming. Turn off stemming by setting
                  # this value to 0. The default value is off (0). When 
                  # stemming is on (1), all the words in a gloss are stemmed
                  # by the Porter stemmer before overlaps are identified.

stopList = stopList.txt

                  # Specifies the name of a stop list, which consists of
                  # words that are to be ignored in a gloss overlap. The
                  # value of this must be a file name, or an absolute or
                  # relative path name. The default is to not use a stop
                  # list. If the value is omitted, then the default is used.
                  # The default value of this option is stoplist.txt.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by the lesk measure

# (currently not supported)
# leskRelation = leskRelation.dat
 
                  # Specifies a lesk relation file. This value can be a file
                  # name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
                  # is to use the file lesk-relation.dat, 
                  # Please note that the format of the lesk relation file is 
                  # not the same as that of the vector relation file. The lesk 
                  # relation file consists of relation pairs that specify 
                  # glosses that are to be compared for overlaps. 

leskNormalize = 1 # Turns on (1) normalization of lesk scoring. Turn off
                  # by setting this value to 0. The default value is on 
                  # (1). If the value is omitted, then the default is used. 
                  # When normalization is enabled, the gloss overlap score 
                  # is normalized by the size of the glosses. The details 
                  # are described in Banerjee and Pedersen (2002).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following options will be supported by the vector measure
 
# vectorDB = wordVectors.dat
 
                  # Specifies a database file containing word vectors.
                  # The value of this option must be a file name, or an
                  # absolute or relative path name. utils/wordVectors.pl 
                  # must be used to generate this file. This option is
                  # required, and there is no default value. If the 
                  # option is not specified, or if the option is specified
                  # without a value, the vector measure will fail.
 
# vectorRelation = vectorRelation.dat
 
                  # Specifies a vector relation file. This value can be a file
                  # name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
                  # is to use the glos-example relation. If the value is 
                  # ommited, then the default is used. Please note that the 
                  # format of the vector relation file is not the same as 
                  # that of the lesk relation file. The vector relation file
                  # consists of single relations that specify which glossess
                  # of a word will be used in constructing the gloss vector.
 
# compounds = wn30compounds.txt
 
                  # Specifies a file of WordNet compounds. The value of
                  # this option must be a file name, or an absolute or
                  # relative path. The program utils /compounds.pl can 
                  # be used to generate this file. When compounds are 
                  # specified, compound words that occur in glosses are
                  # identified prior to creating word vectors. The default 
                  # is to ignore compound words. If the value of this 
                  # option is omitted, then the default is used. 

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option may be supported by the random measure

# maxRand = 1     # The random measure will generate measures between 0
                  # and this value. The value of this option may be an
                  # integer or a real number. The default value is 1.
                  # If the value of this option is omitted, then the 
                  # default is used.
